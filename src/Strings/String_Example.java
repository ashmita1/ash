	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String s1 = "java";
		s1.concat(" rules");
		System.out.println("s1 refers to "+s1);  // Yes, s1 still refers to "java"
		
//		What's happening:
//
//		The first line is pretty straightforward: create a new String "java" and refer s1 to it.
//		Next, the VM creates another new String "java rules", but nothing refers to it. So, the second String is instantly lost. We can't reach it.
//		The reference variable s1 still refers to the original String "java".
//
//		Almost every method, applied to a String object in order to modify it, creates new String object. 
//		So, where do these String objects go? Well, these exist in memory, 
//				and one of the key goals of any programming language is to make efficient use of memory.
//
//		As applications grow, it's very common for String literals to occupy large area of memory,
//		which can even cause redundancy. So, in order to make Java more efficient, 
//		the JVM sets aside a special area of memory called the "String constant pool".s
//
//		When the compiler sees a String literal, it looks for the String in the pool. 
//		If a match is found, the reference to the new literal is directed to the existing String and no new String object is created. 
//		The existing String simply has one more reference. Here comes the point of making String objects immutable:
//
//		In the String constant pool, a String object is likely to have one or many references. 
//		If several references point to same String without even knowing it, it would be bad 
//		if one of the references modified that String value. That's why String objects are immutable.
//
//		Well, now you could say, what 
//		if someone overrides the functionality of String class? 
//				That's the reason that the String class is marked final so that nobody can override the behavior of its methods.
